            <p className="mt-4 text-lg">darel's Projects is a website where I store my projects. As a videographer and editor by hobby, I often bring cameras when I'm out with friends. After our adventures, I edit the videos and upload them to this site. It serves as a place for us to watch them together and as an archive for everything we do.</p>
