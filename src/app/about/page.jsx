            <p className="mt-8 sm:mt-16 text-lg leading-relaxed sm:leading-loose">darel's Projects is a website where I store my projects. As a videographer and editor by hobby, I often bring cameras when I'm out with friends. After our adventures, I edit the videos and upload them to this site. It serves as a place for us to watch them together and as an archive for everything we do.</p>
